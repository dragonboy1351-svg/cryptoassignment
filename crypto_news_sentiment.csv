2025-08-08 04:06:57,The U.S. imposed sanctions on 18 entities for helping Iran evade sanctions and generate revenue,"The U.S. has dropped a heavy hand on Iran by sanctioning 18 entities and individuals that are part of a network helping the country evade sanctions and funnel money. This move, announced by the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, is all about keeping the pressure on Iran, who the U.S. believes continues to flout international sanctions. This network includes companies like RUNC Exchange System Company, Cyrus Offshore Bank, and Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, all of which are accused of working behind the scenes to keep Iran’s economy moving despite sanctions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made it clear that these new measures are part of a broader U.S. strategy to choke off Iran’s financial lifeblood. He emphasized that Washington intends to keep targeting the channels Iran uses to evade sanctions, with the ultimate goal of blocking the revenue that funds the country’s military programs. “Treasury will continue to disrupt Iran’s schemes aimed at evading our sanctions, block its access to revenue, and starve its weapons programs of capital in order to protect the American people,” he said. Targeting key players in Iran’s financial web The new sanctions are focused on companies and individuals that provide Iran with a way to get around the financial restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. RUNC Exchange is one of the main targets, a company accused of being involved in illegal money transfers, making it easier for Iran to sidestep American financial regulations. Another big target is Cyrus Offshore Bank, a key player in moving money that Iran needs to fund its activities. Alongside these, Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, an Iranian tech company, has been added to the list due to its connections to financial dealings linked to Iran’s controversial activities. The Treasury’s efforts go beyond just freezing assets or imposing financial restrictions. This is part of an ongoing attempt by the U.S. to dismantle the network of firms and individuals helping Iran stay afloat economically. Washington’s message is clear: businesses and institutions that choose to engage with Iran will face consequences. It’s a tactic that’s been ramped up in recent years, as Iran continues to search for ways to bypass sanctions and keep its economy moving, especially in sectors that fund its military ambitions. Oil prices react to tariffs and sanctions While the sanctions hit Iran, the broader global market is feeling the heat of new U.S. tariffs. On Thursday, U.S. tariffs against several trade partners went into effect, raising concern about economic slowdowns that could dampen demand for oil. Early Friday trading saw Brent crude at $66.40 per barrel, with a week-over-week drop of more than 4%. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures slid to $63.82 a barrel, marking a more than 5% decline over the week. The market reaction stems from fears that global economic growth could slow due to these tariffs. In turn, this could reduce the demand for crude oil, as noted by ANZ Bank analysts. This comes on top of decisions made by the OPEC+ group to roll back significant oil output cuts sooner than expected, pushing oil prices even lower. At the same time, the Kremlin confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump would meet soon to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort is expected to have a major impact on global markets. Even though Russia’s oil exports continue despite sanctions, new tariffs on India for buying Russian crude oil have kept pressure on oil prices, with analysts warning that the tariff move won’t drastically reduce the flow of Russian oil into global markets.

2025-08-08 04:00:36,Crypto Industry Split Between Congress’s Versions Of Market Structure Bill – Here’s Why,"As the US Congress continues to work on crypto-related legislation, some industry leaders disagree on which version of the market structure bill will provide the much-needed clarity to the sector. Paradigm Champions Senate’s Crypto Bill On Thursday, several industry players discussed the differences between the US Congress’s versions of one of the landmark crypto bills. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the sector is now focused on the key market structure legislation, which is expected to offer the long-awaited clarity and protection for the industry. Notably, the House of Representatives introduced and already passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the US, facilitate the growth of crypto projects, and protect customers. In June, the US Senate started working on principles for its version of the market structure legislation, looking to draft a comprehensive set of rules. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Senate Banking Committee released a draft of its “framework of principles,” outlining six key principles for the upcoming crypto bill, which were allegedly “very well received” by the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Today, Paradigm’s General Partner, Dan Robinson, shared the firm’s response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft on the bill, suggesting that this version is the best approach. Chainlink Labs, Galaxy Digital, Tribe Capital, Multicoin Capital, Electric Capital, and Ribbit Capital co-signed the letter. Robinson argued that while both bills are an “improvement on the Howey -based regime (…), the Senate draft is significantly simpler, and avoids forcing decentralized tokens and protocols to fit themselves into an inflexible legislative framework.” The lawyer explained that the Senate’s draft focuses on the concept of ancillary assets, which “distinguishes the typical crypto asset from securities due to its innate nature.” To the firms, this is the “cleanest test” that protects decentralized crypto assets while preventing traditional securities issuers from improperly exploiting this framework. Paradigm’s VP of Regulatory Affairs added that if regulatory clarity involves replacing the current “inscrutable regime that no one can register under or operate in with another complex regime that requires a phalanx of lawyers & millions of dollars to comprehend, this exercise will have failed.” Industry Players Divided Over Legislation In an X post, journalist Eleanor Terret noted that most of the major crypto Venture Capital (VC) firms, except a16z crypto, “aligned on market structure and token classification for the first time.” Nonetheless, a16z crypto’s Head of Policy and General Counsel, Miles Jennings, disagreed , stating “most major crypto hedge funds is more accurate. Most major crypto VCs supported CLARITY’s token maturity framework.” Jennings highlighted the Decentralization Research Center’s (DRC) summary chart comparing the Senate and House’s versions, arguing that “the undermining of CLARITY’s transfer restriction framework creates short-term incentives to circumvent decentralization and dump on retail. That’s not good for innovation.” Earlier this week, the DCR also submitted its response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft, underscoring the importance of “building on the strong foundation established by the CLARITY Act.” The non-profit organization considers that while the Senate’s version is still evolving, the House’s “robust, control-based decentralization test” is the better approach. Last month, the DCR and 50 other leading industry players sent a joint letter to Congress leaders supporting the CLARITY Act, the largest coalition of organizations in agreement on a particular test for decentralization, as the post noted. Additionally, the non-profit affirmed that “sound market structure legislation must be grounded in control” and regulatory attention must focus on where it is warranted, while “preserving space for innovation and open systems.” Similarly, attorney Gabriel Shapiro concurred that “the House approach is far superior.” To him, the Senate’s test is a “pure race to the bottom” with “stuff that makes no sense from a policy perspective.” The fewer rights people have, the less regulated something is? it should be the opposite–if they have more rights, they are more protected under general contract law and there is less need for regulation. . . this is how you get pure memecoin mania forever, equity/token conflict of interest forever, etc. . .",bitcoinist,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|LINK|RESEARCH,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-industry-split-market-structure-bill/,cryptoindustrysplitbetweencongresssversionsofmarketstructurebillhereswhy,astheuscongresscontinuestoworkoncryptorelatedlegislationsomeindustryleadersdisagreeonwhichversionofthemarketstructurebillwillprovidethemuchneededclaritytothesectorparadigmchampionssenatescryptobillonthursdayseveralindustryplayersdiscussedthedifferencesbetweentheuscongresssversionsofoneofthelandmarkcryptobillsfollowingthepassageofthegeniusactthesectorisnowfocusedonthekeymarketstructurelegislationwhichisexpectedtoofferthelongawaitedclarityandprotectionfortheindustrynotablythehouseofrepresentativesintroducedandalreadypassedthedigitalassetmarketclarityclarityactof2025whichseekstoestablisharegulatoryframeworkforcryptoassetsintheusfacilitatethegrowthofcryptoprojectsandprotectcustomersinjunetheussenatestartedworkingonprinciplesforitsversionofthemarketstructurelegislationlookingtodraftacomprehensivesetofrulesasreportedbybitcoinistthesenatebankingcommitteereleasedadraftofitsframeworkofprinciplesoutliningsixkeyprinciplesfortheupcomingcryptobillwhichwereallegedlyverywellreceivedbythedecentralizedfinancedefisectortodayparadigmsgeneralpartnerdanrobinsonsharedthefirmsresponsetothesenatebankingcommitteesdiscussiondraftonthebillsuggestingthatthisversionisthebestapproachchainlinklabsgalaxydigitaltribecapitalmulticoincapitalelectriccapitalandribbitcapitalcosignedtheletterrobinsonarguedthatwhilebothbillsareanimprovementonthehoweybasedregimethesenatedraftissignificantlysimplerandavoidsforcingdecentralizedtokensandprotocolstofitthemselvesintoaninflexiblelegislativeframeworkthelawyerexplainedthatthesenatesdraftfocusesontheconceptofancillaryassetswhichdistinguishesthetypicalcryptoassetfromsecuritiesduetoitsinnatenaturetothefirmsthisisthecleanesttestthatprotectsdecentralizedcryptoassetswhilepreventingtraditionalsecuritiesissuersfromimproperlyexploitingthisframeworkparadigmsvpofregulatoryaffairsaddedthatifregulatoryclarityinvolvesreplacingthecurrentinscrutableregimethatnoonecanregisterunderoroperateinwithanothercomplexregimethatrequiresaphalanxoflawyersmillionsofdollarstocomprehendthisexercisewillhavefailedindustryplayersdividedoverlegislationinanxpostjournalisteleanorterretnotedthatmostofthemajorcryptoventurecapitalvcfirmsexcepta16zcryptoalignedonmarketstructureandtokenclassificationforthefirsttimenonethelessa16zcryptosheadofpolicyandgeneralcounselmilesjenningsdisagreedstatingmostmajorcryptohedgefundsismoreaccuratemostmajorcryptovcssupportedclaritystokenmaturityframeworkjenningshighlightedthedecentralizationresearchcentersdrcsummarychartcomparingthesenateandhousesversionsarguingthattheunderminingofclaritystransferrestrictionframeworkcreatesshorttermincentivestocircumventdecentralizationanddumponretailthatsnotgoodforinnovationearlierthisweekthedcralsosubmitteditsresponsetothesenatebankingcommitteesdiscussiondraftunderscoringtheimportanceofbuildingonthestrongfoundationestablishedbytheclarityactthenonprofitorganizationconsidersthatwhilethesenatesversionisstillevolvingthehousesrobustcontrolbaseddecentralizationtestisthebetterapproachlastmonththedcrand50otherleadingindustryplayerssentajointlettertocongressleaderssupportingtheclarityactthelargestcoalitionoforganizationsinagreementonaparticulartestfordecentralizationasthepostnotedadditionallythenonprofitaffirmedthatsoundmarketstructurelegislationmustbegroundedincontrolandregulatoryattentionmustfocusonwhereitiswarrantedwhilepreservingspaceforinnovationandopensystemssimilarlyattorneygabrielshapiroconcurredthatthehouseapproachisfarsuperiortohimthesenatestestisapureracetothebottomwithstuffthatmakesnosensefromapolicyperspectivethefewerrightspeoplehavethelessregulatedsomethingisitshouldbetheoppositeiftheyhavemorerightstheyaremoreprotectedundergeneralcontractlawandthereislessneedforregulationthisishowyougetpurememecoinmaniaforeverequitytokenconflictofinterestforeveretc,0.0

2025-08-08 04:00:00,Bitcoin’s Comeback or Bull Trap? Analysts Warn of ‘Excessive Optimism’,"Bitcoin’s recent price action has drawn renewed attention as the asset attempts to rebound from last week’s decline. Following its July peak above $123,000, BTC experienced a downturn, hitting lows around $112,000 over the weekend. However, the latest data now suggest a gradual recovery in progress, with the cryptocurrency trading above $116,000 at the time of writing. Despite this modest rebound, some analysts are warning that underlying market sentiment could be pointing to a potential correction. Recent insights from contributors on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform highlight signs of increasing optimism among traders, particularly on Binance. The balance between long and short positions is showing a distinct bias toward the long side, a pattern historically associated with short-term reversals. Related Reading: US Delay On Bitcoin Audit Is A Bullish Red Flag, Says Strike CEO Sentiment Indicators Raise Red Flags on Binance CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest recently discussed how sentiment on Binance, based on long-short positioning, has shifted notably into positive territory. According to BorisVest, the platform’s sentiment metric has shown a surge in long positions as BTC moved from $112,000 to $115,000. He noted that such spikes often coincide with price corrections. “The clustering of green bars in the sentiment chart suggests that traders are increasingly expecting prices to rise. However, excessive optimism tends to be countered by market corrections,” he explained. The analyst added that Binance, given its dominant share in trading volume, provides valuable insight into broader trader behavior. When the long position concentration grows during price increases, it may indicate a potential round of profit-taking. BorisVest stated that a meaningful correction would likely require BTC to fall below the $110,000 mark, which could offer more favorable re-entry points for buyers while restoring balance to the market structure. Bitcoin Leverage Data Shows Mixed Signals for Recovery In a related post, another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, examined the ongoing decline in Binance’s leverage ratio. Typically, a reduction in leverage is interpreted as a signal that overleveraged traders are exiting the market, thereby reducing volatility and risk of forced liquidations. “Lower leverage suggests less speculative behavior in the short term,” Arab Chain noted, “which often contributes to more stable price action.” Related Reading: Japanese Financial Giant SBI Moves Forward With Bitcoin-XRP ETF Application However, Arab Chain also pointed out that both leverage and price have been falling in tandem, which may reflect weak demand from spot buyers. This combination indicates that the recent downturn lacks sufficient buying support, raising concerns about the strength of Bitcoin’s current recovery.

2025-08-08 03:45:30,Dogecoin Price Drops 5%—Analysts Warn XRP and Shiba Inu Could Be Next,"Dogecoin (DOGE) took a sharp hit in early August, falling nearly 5% in 24 hours and extending a broader 12% decline over the past week. Heavy sell-offs pushed DOGE below the $0.205 support mark, triggering a spike in trading volume—at one point reaching nearly 878 million tokens exchanged in a single session. The intense volume suggests institutional exits and broader market risk aversion are both in play. Historically, August has not been kind to DOGE. Median monthly returns have been negative for three years in a row. This time is no different, with some analysts warning of further losses toward $0.185 unless DOGE reclaims key levels quickly. As bearish sentiment lingers, attention is turning to other top meme coins like XRP and SHIBA INU, where similar vulnerabilities are forming. Amid these negative trends, Analysts have shown positivity towards emerging alts like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Struggles to Stay Above $3.00 XRP, Ripple’s flagship token, has remained a top performer in 2025 thanks to regulatory clarity, but recent price action suggests trouble may be brewing. After rebounding from a $2.80 low, XRP is once again stuck under resistance at $3.09, with support forming just below at $2.91. Analysts note that large short positions—along with sharp $50M+ whale transfers—are introducing instability. Market models suggest XRP could swing between $2.94 and $3.39 in August, but some are betting on a breakout to $4.45 if conditions turn favorable. Still, the immediate outlook remains cloudy unless volume increases and institutional sentiment recovers. A drop below $2.91 would likely trigger cascading sell-offs. SHIB Faces Ongoing Sell Pressure Despite Burns Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also under pressure. The token is hovering around $0.0000122, down more than 35% year-to-date and nearly 8% in the past day alone. Even with over 600 million tokens burned recently, sellers continue to dominate. The bearish trend has remained intact for months. Technical charts offer some hope: if SHIB can break above $0.000013 resistance, it could rally 24% to $0.000015. But with crypto-linked stocks falling and speculative capital pulling back, traders remain cautious. Most analyst models predict further weakness before any meaningful upside returns. Bullish Momentum Switches To High Growth Altcoins As DOGE, XRP, and SHIB face uncertain short-term outlooks, a rising number of investors are looking to newer assets with strong foundations and upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in altcoin circles. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, security-verified , and attracting a growing global community. The project’s security-first architecture and zero-tax model are drawing both whales and early investors alike. With the presale still active and a structured roadmap already underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an increasingly rare chance for conviction-based entry—especially amid altcoin uncertainty. Conclusion: Market Uncertainty Builds as Whales Reposition The meme coin market is at a crossroads. DOGE is slipping, XRP is coiling for a big move, and SHIB remains locked in bearish momentum. While short-term pain persists, long-term opportunity is quietly shifting toward newer, more resilient ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling pick for long-term gains—especially as major players rotate capital toward high-conviction altcoins with real traction.

2025-08-08 03:36:33,XRP Bull Flag Points to $8 as Ripple-SEC Case Reaches End,"XRP smashed resistance barriers as trading volume hit 300 million during peak institutional buying surge, with bullish chart patterns and a landmark legal resolution fueling upside bets. The rally combines technical breakout pressure with a significant shift in the token’s fundamental narrative. The SEC settlement eliminates a multi-year litigation drag, potentially unlocking greater institutional participation in U.S. markets. Price action shows heavy accumulation above $3.10, followed by consolidation above $3.30 — suggesting strong conviction among buyers even after the initial spike. The ETF filing from SBI adds a parallel demand driver, positioning XRP for higher beta moves if spot Bitcoin ETF inflows continue. Technical Analysis Overview XRP explodes 11% higher in the 24-hour period ending August 8, rocketing from $2.99 to $3.30 in a blistering rally. The digital asset accelerates most aggressively between 19:00-22:00, obliterating multiple resistance levels. Trading volume erupts past 300 million at 21:00 alone. The session spans a $0.35 range, marking 12% volatility from $2.97 lows to $3.33 peaks. New resistance forms at $3.33. Strong demand emerges above $3.10 in the session's final hours. News Background The Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have jointly ended their appeals in the high-profile XRP lawsuit, concluding a multi-year legal battle that has clouded the token’s outlook since 2020. In a Thursday filing, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the dismissal, with both sides agreeing to bear their own costs and fees. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on X. The resolution removes a major regulatory overhang for XRP, coming alongside other bullish developments such as Japan’s SBI Holdings filing to launch a Bitcoin-XRP ETF. Price Action Summary • XRP surges 11% from August 7 01:00 to August 8 00:00, blasting from $2.99 to $3.30 on explosive 300 million volume • Token consolidates in tight $0.04 band between $3.30-$3.33 during August 7 23:42 to August 8 00:41 window • Bull flag formations point to $8.00-$15.00 breakout targets as legal resolution clears path for institutional entry Technical Indicators Analysis • Volume explodes past 300 million at 21:00, signaling heavy institutional accumulation • Bull flag formations point to $8.00-$15.00 breakout targets over longer horizons • Fresh resistance locks in at $3.33 with volume confirmation • Key support zone holds firm above $3.30 during consolidation • Evening hours see multiple resistance breaks between 19:00-22:00 • Volume-backed demand materializes above $3.10 in session's back half What Traders Are Watching • Follow-through buying from U.S. institutions now that litigation risk has cleared • ETF approval timelines in Japan and potential filings in other markets • Retest of $3.33 resistance and possible breakout toward $3.65 near-term target • Retail re-engagement after legal victory headlines",coindesk,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|ASIA,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/08/xrp-bull-flag-points-to-usd8-as-ripple-sec-case-reaches-end,xrpbullflagpointsto8asrippleseccasereachesend,xrpsmashedresistancebarriersastradingvolumehit300millionduringpeakinstitutionalbuyingsurgewithbullishchartpatternsandalandmarklegalresolutionfuelingupsidebetstherallycombinestechnicalbreakoutpressurewithasignificantshiftinthetokensfundamentalnarrativethesecsettlementeliminatesamultiyearlitigationdragpotentiallyunlockinggreaterinstitutionalparticipationinusmarketspriceactionshowsheavyaccumulationabove310followedbyconsolidationabove330suggestingstrongconvictionamongbuyersevenaftertheinitialspiketheetffilingfromsbiaddsaparalleldemanddriverpositioningxrpforhigherbetamovesifspotbitcoinetfinflowscontinuetechnicalanalysisoverviewxrpexplodes11higherinthe24hourperiodendingaugust8rocketingfrom299to330inablisteringrallythedigitalassetacceleratesmostaggressivelybetween19002200obliteratingmultipleresistancelevelstradingvolumeeruptspast300millionat2100alonethesessionspansa035rangemarking12volatilityfrom297lowsto333peaksnewresistanceformsat333strongdemandemergesabove310inthesessionsfinalhoursnewsbackgroundthesecuritiesandexchangecommissionandripplelabshavejointlyendedtheirappealsinthehighprofilexrplawsuitconcludingamultiyearlegalbattlethathascloudedthetokensoutlooksince2020inathursdayfilingthesecondcircuitappealscourtrecognizedthedismissalwithbothsidesagreeingtobeartheirowncostsandfeesfollowingthecommissionsvotetodaythesecandrippleformallyfileddirectlywiththesecondcircuittodismisstheirappealsrippleschieflegalofficerstuartalderotysaidonxtheresolutionremovesamajorregulatoryoverhangforxrpcomingalongsideotherbullishdevelopmentssuchasjapanssbiholdingsfilingtolaunchabitcoinxrpetfpriceactionsummaryxrpsurges11fromaugust70100toaugust80000blastingfrom299to330onexplosive300millionvolumetokenconsolidatesintight004bandbetween330333duringaugust72342toaugust80041windowbullflagformationspointto8001500breakouttargetsaslegalresolutionclearspathforinstitutionalentrytechnicalindicatorsanalysisvolumeexplodespast300millionat2100signalingheavyinstitutionalaccumulationbullflagformationspointto8001500breakouttargetsoverlongerhorizonsfreshresistancelocksinat333withvolumeconfirmationkeysupportzoneholdsfirmabove330duringconsolidationeveninghoursseemultipleresistancebreaksbetween19002200volumebackeddemandmaterializesabove310insessionsbackhalfwhattradersarewatchingfollowthroughbuyingfromusinstitutionsnowthatlitigationriskhasclearedetfapprovaltimelinesinjapanandpotentialfilingsinothermarketsretestof333resistanceandpossiblebreakouttoward365neartermtargetretailreengagementafterlegalvictoryheadlines,0.0

2025-08-08 03:25:10,Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: A 24-Hour Shockwave,"BitcoinWorld Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: A 24-Hour Shockwave In the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding market movements is absolutely crucial. Today, we’re diving deep into the recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown reveals significant shifts and offers key insights into market sentiment, especially concerning short positions across major cryptocurrencies. Let’s uncover what these numbers truly mean for traders and investors alike. Understanding Crypto Perpetual Futures Trading and Liquidations What exactly are perpetual futures, and why does their liquidation matter so much? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiry date, making them highly popular for continuous trading. However, they come with significant risk, primarily due to leverage. A crypto liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. When a position is liquidated, the trader loses their initial margin and any remaining funds in that position. It’s a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in perpetual futures trading . Over the last 24 hours, the market witnessed a substantial wave of liquidations, particularly impacting short positions. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: BTC: $53.67 million, Short 84.36% ETH: $175.24 million, Short 87.83% XRP: $24.36 million, Short 76.80% These figures highlight a clear trend: the vast majority of liquidated positions were short bets, meaning traders were betting on prices to fall. When prices unexpectedly rose, these short positions were squeezed, leading to forced closures. This phenomenon, known as a ‘short squeeze,’ can further fuel upward price momentum as liquidations force traders to buy back assets to cover their positions. Why Did So Many Short Liquidations Occur? The high percentage of short liquidations indicates a market that moved against the expectations of many bearish traders. This often happens during periods of unexpected positive price action or when a significant number of traders are over-leveraged on the short side. When a sudden upward price movement occurs, these leveraged short positions quickly become unprofitable, triggering margin calls. For instance, the substantial Bitcoin Ethereum liquidation figures show that even major assets are susceptible to these rapid market shifts. Traders often use high leverage (e.g., 10x, 20x, or even 100x) in perpetual futures to amplify potential gains. However, this also magnifies losses, making even small price movements potentially catastrophic. A tiny price increase against a highly leveraged short position can wipe out an entire account. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone participating in the crypto market. Liquidations are not just isolated events; they can create ripple effects, increasing market volatility and sometimes leading to cascade effects where one liquidation triggers another. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation activity, what can traders do to protect themselves? First and foremost, risk management is paramount. While leverage offers the allure of amplified profits, it demands extreme caution. Consider using lower leverage, especially if you are new to perpetual futures trading or if market conditions are highly volatile. Moreover, always implement strict stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. This is a fundamental tool for managing risk in any leveraged trading scenario. Understanding market sentiment and not blindly following the crowd can also provide an edge. Sometimes, the majority’s position becomes the most vulnerable. Finally, continuous learning about market indicators and technical analysis can help you make more informed decisions. Staying updated on news and macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices is also crucial. Remember, the goal is not just to make profits but to preserve capital. Conclusion: A Clear Picture of Market Dynamics The recent 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation data paints a vivid picture of market volatility and the inherent risks of leveraged trading. The overwhelming dominance of short liquidations across BTC, ETH, and XRP underscores the power of unexpected market movements and the consequences of over-leveraging. For traders, these events serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of robust risk management strategies and a deep understanding of market mechanics. By learning from these breakdowns, participants can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This prevents further losses for the exchange. Why do traders use perpetual futures? Traders use perpetual futures to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. They can also use leverage to amplify potential gains, although this significantly increases risk. What is a ‘short liquidation’ and why is it significant? A short liquidation occurs when a trader who bet on a price decrease (a ‘short’ position) is forced to close their position because the price unexpectedly increased. It’s significant because a large number of short liquidations can trigger a ‘short squeeze,’ pushing prices even higher as traders are forced to buy back assets. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and implementing strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions before they reach the liquidation threshold. Does high crypto perpetual futures liquidation indicate a market top or bottom? High liquidation volumes, especially of one side (e.g., short positions), often indicate a significant price reversal or strong trend continuation. While not definitive, large liquidations can signal exhaustion of a particular market sentiment, potentially leading to a temporary bottom (after a short squeeze) or top (after a long squeeze).

2025-08-08 03:18:05,XRP Surges 12% as Traders Bet on Big Price Swings with 'Straddle' Strategy,"Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) has surged 12% over the past 24 hours, outperforming both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). This double-digit gain has lifted XRP's price to $3.32, its highest level since July 28. The price upswing has been underpinned by sophisticated, anticipatory block option trades on Deribit, involving a bullish bet on volatility. Block trades are large transactions executed over-the-counter and outside of the public order book to minimise their impact on the prevailing market price of an asset. The first block trade executed Thursday involved the simultaneous purchase of 100,000 contracts of the Aug. 29 expiry call and put options at the $3.20 strike. The trader paid over $416,000 in premiums for the so-called long straddle strategy, which stands to profit from wild swings in either direction. A similar large straddle was also booked at the $3.10 strike. The large non-directional flow points to growing institutional interest in XRP, Deribit's Asia Business Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. ""XRP has outperformed BTC this year, and we are now seeing a surge in block trades and institutional interest in XRP options. We have also launched year-end XRP options to cater to this demand,"" Chen said. Traders use straddles when anticipating a major volatility event – such as a big earnings report, a key court ruling, or a significant product launch – but are uncertain whether the impact would be bullish or bearish. The risk-reward profile of a long straddle is defined by unlimited profit potential and limited risk. Coincidentally, on Thursday, the Securities Exchange Commission and Ripple jointly agreed to drop their appeals in the Second Circuit court case, bringing to an end to a prolonged legal tussle. Ripple uses XRP in faciliating cross-border transactions. Limited loss, unlimited gain strategy The maximum loss in long straddles is capped at the total premium paid for both the call and the put. The maximum profit, however, is unlimited as the price can theoretically move up or down indefinitely. To break even, the price must move in either direction by an amount equal to the total premium paid. Options are derivative contracts designed to protect traders from bullish or bearish volatility. A call option provides cover against uptrends in the underlying asset, while a put option offers insurance against market swoons.",coindesk,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/08/xrp-surges-12-as-traders-bet-on-big-price-swings-with-straddle-strategy,xrpsurges12astradersbetonbigpriceswingswithstraddlestrategy,paymentsfocusedcryptocurrencyxrpxrphassurged12overthepast24hoursoutperformingbothbitcoinbtcandethereththisdoubledigitgainhasliftedxrpspriceto332itshighestlevelsincejuly28thepriceupswinghasbeenunderpinnedbysophisticatedanticipatoryblockoptiontradesonderibitinvolvingabullishbetonvolatilityblocktradesarelargetransactionsexecutedoverthecounterandoutsideofthepublicorderbooktominimisetheirimpactontheprevailingmarketpriceofanassetthefirstblocktradeexecutedthursdayinvolvedthesimultaneouspurchaseof100000contractsoftheaug29expirycallandputoptionsatthe320strikethetraderpaidover416000inpremiumsforthesocalledlongstraddlestrategywhichstandstoprofitfromwildswingsineitherdirectionasimilarlargestraddlewasalsobookedatthe310strikethelargenondirectionalflowpointstogrowinginstitutionalinterestinxrpderibitsasiabusinessheadlinchentoldcoindeskxrphasoutperformedbtcthisyearandwearenowseeingasurgeinblocktradesandinstitutionalinterestinxrpoptionswehavealsolaunchedyearendxrpoptionstocatertothisdemandchensaidtradersusestraddleswhenanticipatingamajorvolatilityeventsuchasabigearningsreportakeycourtrulingorasignificantproductlaunchbutareuncertainwhethertheimpactwouldbebullishorbearishtheriskrewardprofileofalongstraddleisdefinedbyunlimitedprofitpotentialandlimitedriskcoincidentallyonthursdaythesecuritiesexchangecommissionandripplejointlyagreedtodroptheirappealsinthesecondcircuitcourtcasebringingtoanendtoaprolongedlegaltusslerippleusesxrpinfaciliatingcrossbordertransactionslimitedlossunlimitedgainstrategythemaximumlossinlongstraddlesiscappedatthetotalpremiumpaidforboththecallandtheputthemaximumprofithoweverisunlimitedasthepricecantheoreticallymoveupordownindefinitelytobreakeventhepricemustmoveineitherdirectionbyanamountequaltothetotalpremiumpaidoptionsarederivativecontractsdesignedtoprotecttradersfrombullishorbearishvolatilityacalloptionprovidescoveragainstuptrendsintheunderlyingassetwhileaputoptionoffersinsuranceagainstmarketswoons,0.0

2025-08-08 03:10:11,DOGE Whales Ignite Market: $50M Dogecoin Buying Spree Signals Bullish Momentum,"BitcoinWorld DOGE Whales Ignite Market: $50M Dogecoin Buying Spree Signals Bullish Momentum The cryptocurrency market is always buzzing with activity, and recently, the spotlight has turned sharply on Dogecoin. A significant event involving DOGE whales has caught the attention of investors worldwide, suggesting potential shifts in the popular meme coin’s trajectory. This surge in buying activity signals a renewed interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s future, creating a ripple of excitement among enthusiasts. What Are DOGE Whales Doing? In a move that has sent ripples across the crypto community, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported on X (formerly Twitter) a remarkable accumulation by large holders. Specifically, DOGE whales —identified as entities holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE—have collectively acquired a staggering 230 million Dogecoin within a single 24-hour period. This massive purchase amounts to approximately $50.85 million, a substantial sum that underscores the conviction of these major players. This kind of substantial crypto whale activity often precedes significant price movements. Whales, with their deep pockets, can exert considerable influence on market dynamics. Their actions are closely watched as indicators of underlying sentiment and potential trends. For Dogecoin, this influx of capital from large holders suggests a strong belief in its short-term or even long-term potential. Scale of Purchase: 230 million DOGE bought. Value: Approximately $50.85 million. Participants: Whales holding 10M to 100M DOGE. Timeframe: Within 24 hours. How Does This Impact Dogecoin Price? Following this considerable accumulation, the Dogecoin price has already shown a notable positive reaction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, DOGE was trading at $0.2211, marking an impressive 8.19% increase in the past 24 hours. This immediate uptick highlights the market’s responsiveness to significant whale movements. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency are bought, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up demand and, consequently, its price. This positive price action could also trigger a ripple effect, encouraging smaller investors to consider DOGE investment . Increased buying pressure from both whales and retail investors could create a powerful upward momentum. However, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market is volatile, and past performance does not guarantee future results. While this whale activity is a strong bullish signal, various factors can influence Dogecoin’s sustained growth. Transitioning from a mere meme coin, Dogecoin’s recent performance, bolstered by such large purchases, positions it more seriously within the broader meme coin market . This makes it an interesting asset to monitor for those looking for potential gains. What Does This Mean for Your DOGE Investment Strategy? For current and prospective Dogecoin investors, understanding this crypto whale activity is key. While it presents a bullish outlook, it’s also a reminder to conduct thorough research. Whale movements can be influential, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Consider the broader market trends, Dogecoin’s development updates, community sentiment, and overall economic conditions. Actionable Insights for Dogecoin Investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports regarding DOGE whales and other major market players. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile assets like meme coins. Diversify: While Dogecoin might be appealing, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your DOGE investment is for short-term gains or long-term holding based on your financial goals. The recent whale accumulation underscores the dynamic nature of the meme coin market and Dogecoin’s unique position within it. This significant influx of capital is a strong indicator of renewed confidence, but always approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. The recent acquisition of 230 million DOGE by influential DOGE whales , valued at over $50 million, is a powerful statement of confidence in Dogecoin. This substantial crypto whale activity has already contributed to a notable increase in the Dogecoin price , demonstrating the market’s sensitivity to large-scale investments. For anyone considering a DOGE investment , this event serves as a compelling signal within the ever-evolving meme coin market . While promising, prudent investors will combine this insight with their own research and risk management principles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who are DOGE whales? DOGE whales are large holders of Dogecoin, typically defined by the substantial amount of DOGE they possess. In this context, they are entities holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE. 2. What was the recent DOGE whale purchase? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that DOGE whales bought 230 million DOGE, worth approximately $50.85 million, within a 24-hour period. 3. How does whale activity affect Dogecoin’s price? Significant crypto whale activity , especially large purchases, can reduce available supply and increase demand, often leading to a rise in the Dogecoin price . It signals strong confidence from major investors. 4. Is Dogecoin a good investment after this whale activity? While the recent whale activity is a bullish sign for DOGE investment , it is crucial to conduct your own research, consider market volatility, and manage risks. It’s one factor among many to consider for a comprehensive investment strategy. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

2025-08-08 03:08:36,Ethereum Price Momentum Explodes – $4K Could Be Next,"Ethereum price found support near the $3,650 zone and started a fresh surge. ETH is rising and might soon aim for a move above the $3,920 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,750 and $3,800 levels. The price is trading above $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $3,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,920 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,950 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,000 level. A clear move above the $4,000 resistance might send the price toward the $4,220 resistance. An upside break above the $4,220 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,350 resistance zone or even $4,500 in the near term. Are Dips Limited In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,920 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,820 level. The first major support sits near the $3,800 zone. A clear move below the $3,800 support might push the price toward the $3,735 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,680 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,650. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

2025-08-08 03:00:53,"Crypto Is Here To Stay—Even The SEC Can’t Do Anything About It, Analyst Says","The US markets have seen a surge of digital coins. Millions of Americans now hold tokens in their wallets. Blocking all of it suddenly would be nearly impossible. At the same time, leaving this sector with no rules puts everyday investors in harm’s way. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‘Idiots,’ Saylor Fires Back Why Ban Is Off The Table According to Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine, outright banning crypto is off the table. He points out that tens of millions of people own digital assets today. Pulling the plug now would ripple through trading platforms, payment apps, and even major Wall Street firms. Levine argues that such a move would simply drive innovation and jobs offshore. Hostile Past Still Looms Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, most tokens were treated as stocks. That meant they needed to register under securities laws—a process that almost no project could clear. In practice, that stance rendered crypto “illegal” in the US. Many developers and investors felt shut out. Matt Levine: “We will ban crypto” is no longer feasible for the SEC, and “we will ignore crypto because it’s not a security so not our problem” is not very attractive for the SEC. The only choice left is “we will regulate crypto, but in a way that you like. pic.twitter.com/hBFXTmMnh5 — Sar Haribhakti (@sarthakgh) August 7, 2025 According to analysts, crypto serves two purposes: it powers networks and it offers investment chances. That split role creates regulatory headaches. Many tokens act much like shares in a company, yet they also run on open software and community rules. The SEC knows how to protect stock investors, but digital coins need different safeguards. Project Crypto Signals Change Current SEC Chair Paul Atkins launched “Project Crypto” this year. The goal is to carve out faster, clearer paths for token registration. Projects that truly function as securities could follow a new, streamlined process. At the same time, tokens used mainly for network services would face lighter requirements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains ‘Undefeatable’, Tether Chief Says Levine warns that drawing clear lines won’t be easy. How do you tell a governance token from a pure utility token? What level of disclosure makes sense when code can update itself overnight? Those questions will test regulators and industry alike. However, having defined categories would guide honest developers and protect small investors. The SEC now faces a clear choice: use its power, but adapt its toolkit. A full ban would leave retail holders stranded. Total hands-off would leave them exposed to fraud.

2025-08-08 03:00:53,"Top 6 Crypto Casinos in 2025 Ranked by Real Wins, Fast Withdrawals, & Highest RTP for Crypto Players","In 2025, many crypto players aren’t just after giant jackpots, they want platforms that reward consistent, skill-based play. The demand is rising for online casinos that deliver provable fairness, clear RTPs, and fast withdrawals. It’s no longer about flashy games with unclear outcomes or platforms that delay cashouts. Players now prioritize fairness, verified results, and the ability to claim their winnings without waiting. This review highlights the best crypto casinos offering dependable payouts. Spartans leads the list, followed by Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, Bet365, and 1xBet, all selected for their ability to support regular returns. 1 . Spartans: Ranks #1 for Predictable Crypto Casino Wins In 2025, Spartans stands as the top pick for crypto users seeking reliable returns. This platform focuses on fairness, transparency, and immediate crypto withdrawals. Every game; whether it’s slots, crash, or tables, displays RTP data, allowing players to see the odds and outcomes before they place a bet. Supporting major digital assets like BTC, ETH, and USDT, Spartans lets users manage both casino games and sports bets through a single wallet. This setup helps players maintain better control over their balance and betting strategies. Spartans also include built-in fairness tools, giving players proof of random outcomes and access to full payout histories. Though high-risk games are available, the platform leans toward games that offer reliable returns. Instant withdrawals prevent the temptation to keep playing while waiting for payouts, a feature that helps serious bettors avoid loss cycles. Spartans blend speed, transparency, and trust, making it the top choice for consistency-focused crypto gamblers. 2. Stake.com: Well-Known but Built for High-Risk Play Stake.com is one of the biggest names in crypto gaming, boosted by influencer campaigns and a vast game library. Its platform supports provably fair systems and speedy payouts, but the games often carry high variance. While this appeals to thrill-seekers, it can make sustained wins harder to achieve. High-volume withdrawals may be subject to manual checks, and despite its reputation, Stake.com isn’t always the go-to choice for players seeking consistency over adrenaline. 3. Roobet: High-Energy Experience, Low RTP Visibility Roobet is known for its energetic vibe and partnerships with major brands. It’s a hotspot for crash game fans and those chasing big outcomes. However, its game design usually favors risk-heavy mechanics, which can challenge players looking for regular returns. Payout speeds vary, and while the site uses provable fairness, it lacks the full RTP visibility offered by platforms like Spartans. For steady play, Roobet may not check all the boxes. 4. BC.Game: Big Game Catalog, But Delayed Payout Issues BC.Game brings variety through an extensive game catalog and ongoing bonuses. For players who enjoy chasing rewards, it’s a strong option. Still, when it comes to predictable withdrawals, it falls short. Reports of delayed payouts surface regularly, and its RTP details are often buried or unavailable. While it’s entertaining, it’s less suited to those who want measurable long-term betting outcomes. 5. Bet365: Legacy Platform Adding Crypto, Slowly Bet365 has stepped into the crypto space, expanding its payment options for digital asset users. As a legacy betting site, it offers a massive sportsbook and casino, but its crypto tools are still developing. Payout times tend to be slower than those on crypto-first platforms, and there’s limited access to RTP transparency. For crypto bettors wanting speed and clarity, Bet365 may not deliver consistently. 6. 1xBet: Global Reach, But Cashout Consistency Lags With its wide reach and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, 1xBet caters to users across different regions. It offers a mix of games and sportsbook options, but its crypto experience can feel uneven. Slow withdrawals and unclear bonus conditions have raised concerns, especially for players prioritizing consistency. While winnings are possible, the platform’s performance varies based on location and payment methods. Spartans Sets the Bar for Consistent Wins For those who value steady wins over occasional jackpots, choosing the right crypto casino matters more than ever in 2025. Transparent terms, provably fair games, and instant crypto access are key. Spartans rank first by offering all three. With fast withdrawals, high RTP visibility, and built-in fairness, it sets the standard for consistent play. While Stake.com and Roobet excel at delivering excitement, Spartans is built for players who want their skills and strategy rewarded predictably.

2025-08-08 03:00:31,"Crypto Crash Alert: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP—Here’s What Analysts Say Happens Next","The crypto market has entered a volatile phase. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all struggling to maintain recent support levels. Traders are growing cautious as the expected ETF decision remains elusive. Prices are dropping across the board. Risk sentiment is shifting fast. Bitcoin’s fall below its support level has dragged down most altcoins. Ethereum is losing ground despite strong fundamentals. XRP has slipped after a period of relative strength. Analysts now warn of another leg lower if key support levels break. As the market cools off, investors are already eyeing a new entrant—MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Key Levels Bitcoin’s sharp decline has triggered alarm across the market. After briefly consolidating near $116,000, it failed to hold momentum and dropped below $115,000. The move erased recent gains and pushed traders into a defensive stance. Whale activity has dropped. On-chain data shows reduced inflows into major wallets. ETF optimism, once a strong narrative, has now faded into silence. Without an immediate catalyst, analysts believe Bitcoin could retest the $100,000 range. Leverage across futures markets has increased the downside risk. Liquidations have risen, especially among short-term traders. Bitcoin is now in a wait-and-watch zone, dependent on either regulatory clarity or external macro signals. Ethereum Falls Despite Strong Use Case Ethereum has also dropped in value following the broad market volatility. ETH has dropped below its $3,600 support level after it rallied last month. The drop has happened despite its strong developer activity and a growing Layer 2 ecosystem. Institutional flows into ETH have slowed significantly, as seen in its ETFs. Investors seem more focused on preserving capital than chasing rallies. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model continues to reduce supply, but demand has weakened for now. Analysts agree that Ethereum remains one of the most solid projects in crypto. However, its short-term performance remains tied to broader market moves. XRP Dips as Market Cools Off XRP had a strong few weeks after its regulatory clarity in the U.S. However, that momentum has faded. The token has now fallen below its recent high of $3.5 and is testing new short-term lows of $2.95. Institutional interest has also cooled. Ripple’s expansion into global payments continues, but that hasn’t stopped price pressure. Analysts expect XRP to face more downside unless broader sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Visibility as Traders Shift to Early-Stage Tokens As larger assets correct, early-stage tokens are getting attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining visibility as one of the more promising projects in the presale space. Analysts have called it the best crypto presale for new investors targeting big returns, citing its low entry point, capped supply, and well-structured DeFi framework. The project includes governance tools, staking options, and future integrations into decentralized markets. Traders are actively discussing MAGACOIN FINANCE across online forums. Its fresh narrative and untapped potential are driving interest during this volatile period. Many see it as a way to gain asymmetric exposure while avoiding the high volatility of major tokens. Conclusion The crypto market is in a critical phase. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are losing momentum as ETF hopes fade and risk-off sentiment spreads. However, even in downturns, capital finds direction. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a potential breakout in the presale landscape, offering an early-stage opportunity for investors seeking the next trend before the broader market shifts again.

2025-08-08 03:00:26,"Ethereum Rallies, SHIB Stalls, But BlockDAG Tops 2025’s Highest Trending Crypto List","Crypto momentum is accelerating in 2025, but the drivers behind each project tell very different stories. Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of institutional-led growth as accumulation continues and reserves top $10 billion. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the highest trending cryptos, but its July rally now faces technical resistance and potential reversal. And then there’s BlockDAG , a project still in its presale phase, yet already functioning with a live dashboard, mining tools, and a growing user base exceeding 2.5 million. As investors explore what’s real, what’s peaking, and what still has room to grow, BlockDAG presents a structurally sound alternative with actual utility and a favorable entry point. This article compares the current state of Ethereum and Shiba Inu to BlockDAG’s fundamentals and ROI potential to explain why it’s attracting early participants ahead of its launch. Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally News Ethereum is gaining traction with institutional support driving its current rally. Whale wallets added over 833,000 ETH , valued at more than $3 billion , in recent accumulation waves, pushing ETH beyond $3,700 . Even more notably, Ethereum’s combined reserves across regulated custodians and institutional wallets have now exceeded $10 billion . The catalyst appears to be growing interest in ETH-based spot ETFs, such as BlackRock’s ETHA product, and continued demand from DeFi and staking ecosystems. From a structural standpoint, ETH’s chart remains bullish, with analysts targeting a potential run toward $6,000 if current levels hold. That would mark a new cycle high for the network and reinforce Ethereum’s position as a resilient Layer 1 protocol. However, at its current maturity and price, Ethereum’s upside, while promising, is no longer early-stage. The opportunity now lies in whether it can sustain momentum in the face of tightening liquidity across broader markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Hurdles Shiba Inu’s July surge was among the strongest short-term moves this year, briefly rising over 30% . But it now faces a familiar challenge: sustaining momentum through resistance. SHIB’s current price structure is trapped in a descending channel , characterized by lower highs and lower lows. Unless it breaks out of that formation, analysts warn the July gains could quickly erode. Technical indicators show RSI in the overbought zone, hovering around 78, while exchange reserves have climbed, suggesting whales may be positioning to take profits. Without reclaiming structural support and resistance zones, SHIB risks fading back toward its pre-rally levels. While it remains a high-volume, highly searched token, technical strength and upside clarity remain limited. Traders are watching closely, but the path forward demands a decisive breakout. BlockDAG: The Highest Trending Crypto with Real Utility and ROI Structure In contrast to ETH’s maturity and SHIB’s technical limitations, BlockDAG offers something fundamentally different, a live, utility-driven ecosystem before the token even launches . The presale has already crossed $364 million , with the current $0.0016 price available until August 11 . This presale isn’t operating on speculation; it’s being driven by user participation, functional tools, and a model built for sustained engagement. Dashboard V4 is already live, simulating real exchange functionality. Users can view charts, place simulated trades, and track wallet balances, creating familiarity with trading mechanics well before listing. It’s designed to replace static presale portals with dynamic user experience. The X1 mobile miner , adopted by over 2.5 million users , lets participants simulate daily mining, offering 20 BDAG/day in a gamified format. Its hardware counterpart, the X10 , has been demoed producing up to 200 BDAG/day , creating a layered mining system that’s both accessible and scalable. BlockDAG’s underlying architecture is also built for long-term performance. It combines blockchain security with DAG efficiency, enabling transaction speeds between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS . The system will support smart contracts, dApps, and eventual cross-chain capabilities, giving it the adaptability of a modern Layer 1 chain with a broader user funnel. But one of the clearest investor motivators is the ROI math . At the current price of $0.0016 : If BDAG lists at $0.05 , early buyers would see a 3,025% return At $1 , ROI increases to 62,400% If it reaches $10 , the return climbs to 624,900% These projections are not theoretical stretch goals, they’re straightforward calculations based on today’s pricing structure. With no vesting applied to current buyers and 20 exchange listings already confirmed, the liquidity path is defined and immediate. Gamified mechanics like Buyer Battles and the 10 BTC Auction add additional buying incentives, awarding unsold token allocations or BTC rewards to top daily participants. These systems sustain community activity and reinforce BlockDAG’s appeal beyond passive investing. Where Ethereum reflects stability and Shiba Inu reflects volatility, BlockDAG stands as a functional growth engine, engaging users now while offering asymmetric upside upon launch. The project’s clear roadmap, working tools, and growing network suggest it’s not just the highest trending crypto today, but one of the most structurally compelling new assets entering the market in 2025. The Last Line Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong, driven by institutional support and ETF interest, but its upside is increasingly priced in. Shiba Inu, while still trending, faces resistance and lacks structural confirmation for further gains. BlockDAG, however, presents a balanced opportunity that blends real-time user engagement, technical scalability, and unmatched presale ROI potential. With $364 million raised, a token price of $0.0016, and millions already participating through Dashboard V4 and mobile mining, BlockDAG is not just gaining attention, it’s earning it. For investors looking beyond headlines and into functional value, BlockDAG is the clear standout in 2025’s high-potential crypto landscape.

2025-08-08 03:00:05,Cold Wallet Locks In $270M Deal Mid-Presale While LINK Targets $22 & LTC Builds Under ETF Pressure,"Momentum is building fast across the crypto sector, and three names are catching serious traction for very different reasons. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is becoming increasingly bullish as it aims to reclaim the $22 range. Litecoin (LTC), despite facing an ETF ruling delay, is showing signs of a strong technical setup that has analysts intrigued. But the most unexpected and aggressive move comes from Cold Wallet. Still in presale, Cold Wallet (CWT) just acquired Plus Wallet in a massive $270 million transaction. This deal not only brought in over 2 million users, but also confirmed that over 645 million CWT tokens have already been sold. With a potential 4,900% ROI from its current $0.00942 price to launch, Cold Wallet is doing more than promising; it’s delivering. Chainlink (LINK) Price Outlook Turns Bullish as $22 Comes Into View Chainlink’s rebound has flipped the narrative. With a 2.44% bounce pushing LINK to around $14.66, confidence is returning to the market. Analysts tracking the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook are now revising short-term projections upward, with targets ranging between $22 and $28 if momentum continues through the next quarter. This is a notable recovery from July lows and reflects growing belief in Chainlink’s real-world relevance. At the core of Chainlink’s value is its decentralized oracle network, which enables smart contracts to securely pull off-chain data into on-chain environments. With new integrations rolling out and institutional interest growing, LINK’s role in Web3 infrastructure keeps expanding. It remains one of the few projects that bridges traditional data with decentralized ecosystems. While crypto volatility remains a factor, Chainlink’s history of uptime, security, and ongoing development puts it in a favorable position. Should demand for reliable oracles rise, LINK may not just return to the top 10, it might lead a new wave of data-centric crypto adoption. Litecoin (LTC) Recent Update: ETF Decision Paused, But Bullish Pattern Holds The Litecoin (LTC) recent update focuses on the SEC’s delay in approving the proposed Litecoin ETF. While delays typically rattle confidence, this one hasn’t shaken LTC’s technical structure. The price continues to consolidate within a bullish flag pattern that suggests potential for an upward breakout. A confirmed move past $95 could open a run toward $110 or even $120, according to multiple technical analysts. Litecoin continues to attract attention as a reliable and efficient blockchain. Known for fast transactions and low fees, it holds many of the same traits that have kept Bitcoin popular, but operates with higher speed and greater flexibility. Its capped supply and consistent network uptime give it staying power as a hedge in the altcoin market. Despite institutional approval being postponed, underlying market behavior shows steady accumulation. If technical support remains intact and price action confirms the breakout, Litecoin could quickly return to its status as a reliable top crypto performer in the current cycle. Cold Wallet Transforms Presale Model with $270M Acquisition and Real Utility Cold Wallet isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating infrastructure. While still in Stage 16 of its presale, priced at just $0.00942, Cold Wallet has already moved over 645 million CWT coins, raising more than $5.75 million. That alone would make it notable, but the bigger story is the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, bringing more than 2 million active accounts into its network. This is more than a merger of names. Cold Wallet is absorbing Plus Wallet’s proven usability and integrating it with CWT-powered cashback functionality. Users now earn rewards on every gas fee, token swap, and fiat transaction, automatically and with no staking or complex onboarding. It’s a clear shift from the standard crypto presale that sells ideas without showing results. ColdWallet.com, valued at just $2 million, wasn’t the centerpiece. The value here lies in the platform’s capacity to deliver a real product to a sizable audience before hitting public markets. As the user migration finalizes, full access to the Cold Wallet rewards system becomes available without delay. This kind of rollout, with features, functions, and users in place, is rare in the presale space. All indications suggest that Cold Wallet is preparing for aggressive expansion post-launch. With a structured roadmap, active user base, and embedded earning mechanisms, it’s setting a new standard for self-custody crypto solutions. This isn’t a theoretical play; it’s one of the top crypto performers stepping into the spotlight with proof already in hand. Who’s Really Leading the 2025 Crypto Field? Chainlink and Litecoin are both showing clear signs of life. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook continues to climb, backed by renewed confidence in its oracle utility. The Litecoin (LTC) recent update, although clouded by ETF delays, still points to an imminent technical breakout if resistance breaks. But Cold Wallet is moving differently. While others wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet has created its own. A $270 million acquisition during crypto presale , over 645 million tokens sold, and a live reward ecosystem make it a standout. Where most projects offer roadmaps, Cold Wallet offers working features, real users, and a strong ROI pathway. For anyone watching the rise of top crypto performers, Cold Wallet is more than just a name to know; it’s a real-time shift in how presales can work when execution leads the way.

2025-08-08 03:00:00,Ethereum Derivatives Heat Up: Open Interest Spikes $1.9B,"Data shows the Ethereum Open Interest has shot up alongside the asset’s recovery surge, a sign that chaos could be in store. Ethereum Open Interest Has Gone Up By More Than 8% As explained by CryptoQuant author Maartunn in a new post on X, the Ethereum Open Interest has heated up during the past day. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. It takes into account for both short and long positions. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn, showcasing the recent trend in the Ethereum Open Interest. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum Open Interest has just gone up by around $1.9 billion and reached the $24.5 billion mark. This corresponds to a notable increase of 8.5%. The jump in derivatives market positions has come alongside a price rise for ETH. Generally, sharp price action like a rally attracts the attention of the masses, so speculative activity can note an uptick. The scale of the Open Interest increase, however, does stand out this time around. The cryptocurrency’s price has gone up by 4% during the past day, which, while certainly not small, is only half the rise in the Open Interest. This would indicate particularly intense speculation in the market. Historically, a spike in the indicator is something that has often led into volatility for Ethereum. The reason behind it is that new positions mean the leverage in the sector goes up. This can make mass liquidation events more probable, which tend to unravel in a volatile manner. Considering how strong the climb in the Open Interest has been relative to the asset’s price, it’s possible that sharp action could be ahead for ETH this time as well. A significant amount of liquidations related to the coin have already occurred over the past twelve hours, as data from CoinGlass shows. As is visible above, liquidations related to Ethereum have totaled at $119 million in this period. This makes ETH the coin with the largest derivatives flush, far ahead of Bitcoin’s $32 million in second place. Naturally, the majority of the liquidations have involved short positions. In total, the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has seen $284 million in liquidations during the past day, $233 million of which have come inside the past twelve hours alone. ETH Price With its latest rally, Ethereum has broken away from the rest of the market and recovered above the $3,820 mark.",bitcoinist,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-derivatives-heat-up-open-interest-1-9b/,ethereumderivativesheatupopeninterestspikes19b,datashowstheethereumopeninteresthasshotupalongsidetheassetsrecoverysurgeasignthatchaoscouldbeinstoreethereumopeninteresthasgoneupbymorethan8asexplainedbycryptoquantauthormaartunninanewpostonxtheethereumopeninteresthasheatedupduringthepastdaythisindicatorkeepstrackofthetotalamountofderivativespositionsrelatedtoeththatarecurrentlyopenonallcentralizedexchangesittakesintoaccountforbothshortandlongpositionsbelowisthechartsharedbymaartunnshowcasingtherecenttrendintheethereumopeninterestfromthegraphitsapparentthattheethereumopeninteresthasjustgoneupbyaround19billionandreachedthe245billionmarkthiscorrespondstoanotableincreaseof85thejumpinderivativesmarketpositionshascomealongsideapriceriseforethgenerallysharppriceactionlikearallyattractstheattentionofthemassessospeculativeactivitycannoteanuptickthescaleoftheopeninterestincreasehoweverdoesstandoutthistimearoundthecryptocurrencyspricehasgoneupby4duringthepastdaywhichwhilecertainlynotsmallisonlyhalftheriseintheopeninterestthiswouldindicateparticularlyintensespeculationinthemarkethistoricallyaspikeintheindicatorissomethingthathasoftenledintovolatilityforethereumthereasonbehinditisthatnewpositionsmeantheleverageinthesectorgoesupthiscanmakemassliquidationeventsmoreprobablewhichtendtounravelinavolatilemannerconsideringhowstrongtheclimbintheopeninteresthasbeenrelativetotheassetspriceitspossiblethatsharpactioncouldbeaheadforeththistimeaswellasignificantamountofliquidationsrelatedtothecoinhavealreadyoccurredoverthepasttwelvehoursasdatafromcoinglassshowsasisvisibleaboveliquidationsrelatedtoethereumhavetotaledat119millioninthisperiodthismakeseththecoinwiththelargestderivativesflushfaraheadofbitcoins32millioninsecondplacenaturallythemajorityoftheliquidationshaveinvolvedshortpositionsintotalthecryptocurrencysectorasawholehasseen284millioninliquidationsduringthepastday233millionofwhichhavecomeinsidethepasttwelvehoursaloneethpricewithitslatestrallyethereumhasbrokenawayfromtherestofthemarketandrecoveredabovethe3820mark,0.0
2025-08-08 02:45:11,Ethereum Foundation’s Pivotal $500K Match for Roman Storm Legal Defense,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Foundation’s Pivotal $500K Match for Roman Storm Legal Defense The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news! The Ethereum Foundation , a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, has stepped up in a major way. They are committing to match up to $500,000 in community donations to bolster the Roman Storm legal defense . This move directly supports the co-founder of Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, who is currently navigating complex Tornado Cash legal issues in court. Why is the Ethereum Foundation Stepping Up? Hsiao-Wei Wang, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation , publicly announced this significant commitment on X (formerly Twitter). This decision highlights the foundation’s dedication to supporting individuals facing legal challenges within the decentralized space. Furthermore, it sends a clear signal of solidarity from a prominent entity in the blockchain world. The matching fund initiative aims to provide crucial financial resources for Storm’s ongoing trial. He faces serious charges, including money laundering and sanctions violations, which stem from his involvement with Tornado Cash, a well-known crypto mixer. This support is viewed by many as a defense of core decentralized principles. What Are the Charges Against Roman Storm and Tornado Cash? Roman Storm is a co-founder of Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol designed to enhance transactional privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. Users deposit crypto into a pool and withdraw it later from a different address, effectively obscuring the link between sender and receiver. While this technology serves legitimate privacy needs, it has unfortunately also been exploited by illicit actors. The U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging its use in laundering billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. Storm’s arrest and subsequent trial have sent ripples through the crypto community, raising profound concerns about developer liability and the future of crypto privacy regulations . How Will This Impact Crypto Privacy Regulations and DeFi Legal? This case extends beyond Roman Storm himself. It represents a critical test for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the fundamental principle of financial privacy. The outcome could set powerful precedents for how governments approach open-source software development and the responsibilities of developers whose tools are used for illicit activities. Many in the crypto community view the prosecution of developers as a direct threat to innovation and the fundamental right to privacy. The Ethereum Foundation ‘s support, therefore, underscores the perceived importance of this case for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) legal frameworks globally. It highlights the ongoing tension between regulatory oversight and the ethos of decentralization. How is the Community Supporting Roman Storm? The announcement from the Ethereum Foundation has invigorated the community’s efforts to support Storm. Already, there have been significant grassroots fundraising initiatives from various corners of the crypto world. The foundation’s matching pledge amplifies these efforts, demonstrating a collective commitment to protecting developers and defending privacy-enhancing tools. This collective action showcases the strong sense of community and mutual support within the crypto space. It is a powerful example of how the decentralized ethos can translate into real-world action when foundational principles are perceived to be under threat. Furthermore, it reinforces the idea that the community stands united against what they see as overreach. What Lies Ahead for Tornado Cash Legal Issues? The legal proceedings involving Roman Storm are complex and ongoing. The outcome will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for developers, privacy tools, and the broader regulatory landscape. This case will likely shape future discussions around the intersection of technology, privacy, and law enforcement for years to come. As the trial progresses, the crypto world will be watching closely. The robust support from the Ethereum Foundation and the wider community will be vital for Roman Storm as he navigates these challenging legal waters. This situation emphasizes the urgent need for clearer crypto privacy regulations that effectively balance innovation with legitimate security concerns. In conclusion, the Ethereum Foundation ‘s pledge to match community donations for Roman Storm legal defense is a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It not only provides critical support to an individual facing serious charges but also signals a collective stand on issues of developer liability, privacy, and the future of Tornado Cash legal issues and decentralized finance. This commitment underscores the ongoing battle for regulatory clarity and the preservation of core decentralized principles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Roman Storm and why is he facing legal charges? Roman Storm is a co-founder of Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer. He is facing charges including money laundering and sanctions violations due to the alleged use of Tornado Cash by illicit actors. What is Tornado Cash and why was it sanctioned? Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. It was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in August 2022, which alleged it was used to launder billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. How is the Ethereum Foundation supporting Roman Storm? The Ethereum Foundation has pledged to match up to $500,000 in community donations to support Roman Storm’s legal defense. This initiative aims to provide essential financial resources for his ongoing trial. What are the broader implications of this case for the crypto industry? This case is seen as a crucial test for developer liability and the future of privacy-enhancing tools in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its outcome could set precedents for how governments regulate open-source software and the responsibilities of developers. How can the community contribute to Roman Storm’s legal defense?

2025-08-08 02:29:51,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish Flag and Policy Shifts Fuel $123K Breakout Hopes,"Bitcoin is holding at $116,830 as mainstream adoption is taking off in the US. Sheetz, a popular convenience store chain with locations across multiple states, is offering 50% off all purchases between 3 pm and 7 pm when paid with cryptocurrency through Flexa. The “ Crypto Crave & Save ” promotion is designed to get people spending real crypto in the real world, with payments converted to fiat instantly to protect merchants from volatility. I feel like this is actually bad news for Bitcoin….. https://t.co/jbi5ERD8s7 — titey.eth (@Mtitus6) August 7, 2025 It’s spreading. Steak ‘n Shake just reported saving 50% on payment fees by using Bitcoin over credit cards. These are signs that US businesses are starting to view digital assets as not just investments but as functional payment tools. Regulatory Divergence Between the U.S. and EU Across the Atlantic, the European Banking Authority has finalized draft rules giving “unbacked” crypto assets like Bitcoin a 1,250% risk weight, meaning EU banks would need €12.5 million in capital for every €1 million in BTC holdings. While the measure may limit crypto exposure in Europe, it also formalizes Bitcoin’s place in the financial system, a step analysts say could strengthen long-term adoption. By contrast, U.S. policy is moving in the opposite direction. President Donald Trump announced plans to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, opening the door to a $9 trillion market. Ether rose 4% on the news, and crypto-related equities rallied, with Coinbase gaining 3%, Galaxy Digital 6%, and Bitmine Immersion 8%. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz called it a “milestone” for integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technicals Signal Bullish Continuation From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains in a bullish flag pattern that has been consolidating since late July’s high of $123,255. The pattern’s lower bound aligns with an upward trendline from April and the 50-day SMA at $113,154 — a key support confluence that has drawn consistent buying interest. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is turning positive, with the daily RSI at 54 after bouncing from earlier oversold conditions. Defending the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $113,682 has reinforced the case for an upside move. A breakout above $117,350 could open a path back to $123,255, with further targets at $126,981 and $131,574. If $113,150 fails, however, short-term sentiment may turn cautious, exposing $110,725 and $107,768. Traders eyeing an entry may look for a high-volume move through $117,350 to confirm the breakout. Bitcoin is coiling inside a bullish flag at $116.8K, holding trendline + 50-SMA support. A breakout above $117.35 could target $123K, then $127K. Q4 could be the launchpad for $250K+ in 2025. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/IBPG1rHoF3 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 8, 2025 Bitcoin Price Outlook into Q4 The combination of rising retail adoption, favorable U.S. policy shifts, and a supportive technical structure gives Bitcoin a bullish bias heading into the fourth quarter. If the bullish flag resolves upward, it could mark the start of a new leg higher, potentially paving the way toward the $250K–$500K price projections some analysts are targeting for 2025. With institutional and retail demand converging, BTC’s current consolidation may be less a pause than a launchpad.

The transfer, amounting to 900,000 PENDLE tokens, was swiftly moved to Binance. This information was brought to light by crypto analytics account @EmberCN on X, providing timely insights into the blockchain’s transparent movements. Volume: 900,000 PENDLE tokens. Value: Approximately $4.65 million at the time of transfer. Origin: A multisignature wallet associated with the Pendle protocol. Destination: The prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Such large transfers from project wallets to exchanges often precede significant market events or strategic moves, making them crucial points of interest for investors tracking crypto market activity . Why the Binance Transfer Matters for PENDLE Price Surge Following this substantial Binance transfer , the PENDLE token experienced a remarkable uptick in its price. According to data from CoinMarketCap, PENDLE was trading at $5.09, reflecting an impressive 27.2% increase in just 24 hours. This sudden PENDLE price surge highlights the immediate market reaction to large-scale movements of assets. Several factors could contribute to such a rapid price response: Increased Liquidity: Depositing tokens to an exchange can prepare for increased trading volume, which might be interpreted positively by the market. Strategic Intent: It could signal an upcoming partnership, listing, or a strategic treasury management decision by the Pendle protocol team. Speculative Trading: Traders often react quickly to large transfers, anticipating potential buy or sell pressure, leading to volatility. The market often interprets such a move as a sign of forthcoming developments, leading to a surge in demand and price. Implications for the Pendle Protocol and DeFi Yield Pendle Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. This innovative approach enables users to lock in future yield at a fixed rate or speculate on yield fluctuations. The recent Pendle PENDLE deposit into Binance could have several implications for the protocol’s future and its role within the broader DeFi ecosystem. For the Pendle protocol , this transfer might be part of a broader strategy: Ecosystem Development: Funds might be allocated for new initiatives, partnerships, or expanding the protocol’s offerings. Market Making: The team might be providing liquidity to ensure healthy trading conditions for PENDLE on Binance. Treasury Management: It could be a routine rebalancing or diversification of the protocol’s treasury assets. Understanding these potential reasons is key to grasping the full scope of this significant Binance transfer . Navigating Crypto Market Activity: What Investors Should Know For investors, observing significant transactions like the Pendle PENDLE deposit offers valuable insights into potential market shifts. While a PENDLE price surge is exciting, it is always important to approach such events with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is dynamic and can be volatile. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such crypto market activity : Research Thoroughly: Always look beyond the headlines. Investigate the protocol’s fundamentals, its use cases, and its long-term vision.

2025-08-08 02:11:15,Tesla’s chip and Dojo supercomputer chief departs company,"Tesla is parting ways with one of its most influential hardware leaders. Pete Bannon, the company’s chip and Dojo supercomputer chief, has departed after nearly a decade of service. He joined Tesla in 2016 from Apple, where he had been a key figure in designing the company’s A-series chips. At Tesla, Bannon became instrumental in building the company’s custom silicon capabilities, overseeing projects to help define the automaker’s AI ambitions. Bannon’s most high-profile responsibility was leading the development of Dojo, Tesla’s in-house supercomputer designed specifically for artificial intelligence training. He reported directly to CEO Elon Musk and was considered central to Tesla’s strategy to reduce reliance on external AI hardware providers like Nvidia. His departure comes as Tesla makes a significant strategic pivot. The company has decided to shut down the Dojo program entirely, dissolving the team that has been working on it for years. Engineers from the project are being reassigned to other computing and data center initiatives within Tesla’s broader operations. Bloomberg was the first to break the news, later confirmed by multiple industry sources, that Musk personally ordered the change in direction. At Tesla, Dojo stood out as one of the company’s most ambitious technical projects. The system was intended to be a bespoke AI training platform driven by Tesla-designed chips that could handle the vast amount of video and sensor data collected daily from its global fleet. That data is essential to advancing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotics programs, for which Dojo was expected to be central. Tesla winding down the project represents a huge departure from its AI roadmap. The move suggests the company is stepping back from a strategy of building its own AI chips effectively from scratch toward working more closely with established chip and hardware makers. Musk orders reboot of AI strategy Elon Musk is changing Tesla’s AI strategy . Instead of developing its own computing hardware, Tesla will outsource more to vendors like Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung. The deal signed with Samsung by Tesla for its future-gen A16 AI chips is estimated at $16.5 billion. The company is also rapidly ramping up using Nvidia’s AI training high-performance GPUs. The move is a significant departure from Musk’s initial vision for Dojo, which was intended to become the AI equivalent of Tesla’s well-regarded Supercharger network and a point of differentiation that would help it outpace rivals. The Dojo project has faced technical challenges and delays since its unveiling in 2021. Many engineers who worked on the system have left the company. Around 20 have already moved on to launch an AI startup called DensityAI . Tesla’s decision to close the Dojo team effectively ends its in-house supercomputing push. The company will now channel resources into other AI infrastructure and driver-assistance projects. On the company’s July earnings call, Musk had said Tesla expected the latest Dojo version to run at scale next year. But the abrupt shutdown suggests priorities have shifted. Tesla eyes partnerships for compute needs The service marks a shift for Tesla, which, up until now, has been doing all training computing internally. Most of the heavy lifting will be done by Nvidia’s latest GPUs . AMD is also likely to contribute processing for some projects. Samsung will play a key role in Tesla’s chip production. It’s a way for Tesla to tap into state-of-the-art hardware at little risk and cost instead of just building its gargantuan supercomputers from scratch. The move comes as Tesla tests limited Robotaxi services in Austin and San Francisco. In Austin, a human safety supervisor still rides in the passenger seat. In San Francisco, human drivers operate the vehicles while users hail them through a “Tesla Robotaxi” app. Tesla has seen an exodus of senior talent this year, with the departure of Bannon adding to the list. Former Optimus robotics head Milan Kovac, software VP David Lau, and Musk’s former chief of staff Omead Afshar have also left. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-08-08 02:00:34,"India Escalates Crypto Tax Enforcement With Over 44,000 Notices To Traders","India’s Income Tax Department has intensified its efforts to curb tax evasion in the cryptocurrency sector, sending more than 44,000 notices to traders who failed to disclose their virtual digital asset (VDA) transactions in their income tax returns. Indian Tax Watchdog Ups The Ante In a recent session of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament), India’s Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, revealed that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had launched enforcement actions against non-compliant crypto users. These include reassessment notices, surveys, and search-and-seizure operations under the Income Tax Act, 1961. To promote voluntary compliance, the CBDT has initiated targeted awareness efforts through its NUDGE campaign (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable). Under this program, a total of 44,057 emails and messages were issued to individuals who were found to be investing or trading in crypto assets but had not reported these transactions in their tax filings. The Indian government introduced a tax on digital asset income starting in the 2022-23 financial year. Since then, taxpayers have reported approximately ₹705 crore ($80.6 million) in crypto-linked income for FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 combined. However, enforcement actions such as surveys and raids led to the discovery of an additional ₹630 crore ($72 million) in undisclosed income related to cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that accusations of tax evasion have been directed not only at individual taxpayers, but also at crypto exchanges. Notably, the CBDT is leveraging data analytics tools such as Non-Filer Monitoring System (NFMS), Project Insight, and its internal databases to increase oversight of crypto transactions. The report adds: These tools help cross-reference information provided in tax filings with actual transactions reported by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) via TDS returns. Discrepancies identified through this system are followed up with enforcement actions to ensure accurate reporting and recovery of tax dues. Uncertainty Plagues India’s Crypto Ecosystem While India ranks among the top countries globally for crypto adoption, its taxation and regulatory stance have been a point of contention. The combination of a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% TDS on every trade has discouraged many retail traders and investors. As a result, a number of crypto exchanges in India have reported dwindling trading volumes, leading to businesses announcing layoffs or getting shut. Earlier this year, crypto exchange Bybit announced it was temporarily halting its operations in India due to lack of regulatory clarity. In contrast, neighbouring country Pakistan has shown a more receptive approach toward digital assets. Earlier this year, the South Asian country stated that it would tap excess energy to mine more BTC. Similarly, the UAE continues to cement its place as the global hub for crypto businesses. In November 2024, the nation eliminated Value Added Tax from all transactions in cryptocurrency exchanges and conversions. Despite these challenges, there are signs that India may be reassessing its approach. In July 2025, Pradeep Bhandari, spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called on the government to explore creating a national Bitcoin reserve, suggesting potential long-term interest in integrating crypto into the financial system. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase, the largest US-based crypto exchange, is set to re-enter the Indian market later this year, signaling that global firms remain optimistic about India’s long-term crypto potential, even amid short-term uncertainty.

2025-08-08 02:00:11,The Bitcoin Order: US President Set To Sign Executive Order Protecting Bitcoin Access,"In a bold move that could reshape the crypto landscape, the US President is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order aimed at protecting access to BTC and digital assets. If enacted, this landmark policy would redefine the relationship between digital assets and the US financial system. Bitcoin Steps Into The Political Spotlight Bitcoin has officially entered the hall of power, as the US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would prohibit banks from refusing services to Bitcoin and crypto-related companies. This move signals a major shift in the US policy and ends years of financial censorship against the crypto industry. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition According to a crypto enthusiast, Henry, with this impending order, the crypto industry appears to be getting serious respect from the White House, after years of regulatory uncertainty and political pushback. In the coming days, Henry suggests that positive developments are on the horizon, especially involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This kind of attention from the highest levels of government could shake up the entire market and trigger a wave of institutional interest and volatility. If this happens, it would be more than just good news, as it would be a game-changer. Not only could it act as a major catalyst for BTC, it would also open the doors for crypto businesses to access traditional financial services, which they need for growth. Bitcoin is gaining recognition among the highest forms of governments across the world. Reports show that the Indonesian Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka is exploring the possibility of adding Bitcoin to the country’s national reserves, according to a recent post from Bitcoin Indonesia. The move represents a bold step toward integrating digital assets into sovereign finance. If implemented, Indonesia would become one of the first major Asian economies to formally recognize BTC as a reserve asset, signaling a shift in how governments hedge against inflation, currency risk, and geopolitical uncertainty. The global spotlight is increasingly turning to crypto adoption at the state level. The Bhutan Government Moves $59.2 Million In BTC Several countries are engaging BTC globally at a rapid rate. In a significant and quietly executed move, the government of Bhutan has transferred 517 BTC, valued at approximately $59.2 million, to a new cryptocurrency wallet. This substantial transfer of BTC, reported by Crypto Rover on X, has sparked speculation among analysts and the crypto community about potential custody changes or strategic moves.

The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has consistently maintained a low profile in the world of sovereign crypto holdings, making it one of the most discreet yet active state players in the digital asset space.

2025-08-08 01:54:15,Big News for XRP: SEC and Ripple Jointly Dismiss Appeals. The Case Is Over,"On August 7, 2025, defense lawyer James K. Filan announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs Inc. had jointly filed a dismissal of their respective appeals, bringing an end to one of the most closely followed cases in the digital asset industry. Filan shared the update on X, stating, “The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over.” The Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, formally concludes both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. The document, dated August 7 and signed by the legal representatives of both parties, confirms that each party will bear its costs and fees. This effectively terminates the litigation stemming from the original lawsuit filed by the SEC in December 2020 against Ripple Labs, Bradley Garlinghouse, and Christian A. Larsen. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over. pic.twitter.com/QMATRLnxnS — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) August 7, 2025 Legal Framework and Signatories The legal notice specifically cites Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)(1) as the basis for the dismissal. According to the filing, the Commission, Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen have all agreed to the terms. Attorneys from Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, as well as Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, acted on behalf of Ripple and its executives. On the SEC’s side, the document is signed by Acting General Counsel Jeffrey B. Finnell, Solicitor Tracey A. Hardin, and Appellate Counsel David D. Lisitza and Ezekiel L. Hill. The Certificate of Service, signed by Ezekiel L. Hill, certifies that all relevant parties were electronically served through the Court’s ACMS system on August 7, 2025. Impact on Ripple and XRP This joint dismissal brings closure to the long-standing legal battle, which has significantly impacted XRP’s market position and the broader regulatory outlook for digital assets in the United States. The litigation originally revolved around whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law, with the SEC alleging that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings. Ripple disputed the claims, leading to years of litigation, several partial rulings, and a great deal of public interest. With the appeals now officially withdrawn, there will be no further judicial review of prior rulings from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres. That decision had partially favored Ripple, ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, though it held Ripple accountable for certain institutional sales.

Market participants had long awaited a resolution, as the case’s outcome had implications for token classification and enforcement actions across the sector. Responding to the announcement, the XRP community expressed a range of reactions online. One X user, Tailan, commented humorously, “I was used to this case now is going to be a bit boring who should we fight now? Bank cartels?” As the legal uncertainty lifts, Ripple can now focus on business expansion, including its global payments network and potential U.S. regulatory advancements. The SEC, for its part, appears to be shifting its focus to other digital asset enforcement cases still ongoing in various jurisdictions. The conclusion of this case clears a major legal cloud hanging over XRP and removes a critical overhang from Ripple’s operations. The digital asset community will now closely watch how this final development influences regulatory frameworks, industry innovation, and the positioning of XRP in the evolving financial landscape.
